# pnp_gm_bot
WAS a GameMaster bot for Telegram (sorta MVC)

Now it's a customizable by web interface website for playing games;
Needs refactoring; Very heavy on character creation (recreates base dynamic parms structure which was a bad idea).

Might refactor it in the future to use custom dice roll supply strings (like 5k6+%val+%str added to the DB and parsed as roll)
